          Small Lagoon, a charming destination in Miniloc Island, offers beauty
          in a more intimate setting. Accessible by swimming or kayaking through
          a crack in a limestone wall, visitors can enjoy the serene turquoise
          waters surrounded by cliffs. The natural pool provides a peaceful spot
          for floating or kayaking.

          El Nido's Secret Beach, accessible only by swimming through a hole in
          limestone cliffs, inspired Alex Garland's novel "The Beach" and its
          film adaptation starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Beware of strong waves;
          tour guides provide life vests and assistance for this challenging yet
          rewarding experience.
